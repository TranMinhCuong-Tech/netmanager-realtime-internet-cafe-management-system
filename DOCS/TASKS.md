## 2. Phase 0 Completion Checklist

These decisions are frozen before deeper coding:

- [x] Confirm final source folder structure for `ServerApp`, `ClientApp`, `Shared`, `ServerApp/Auth`, and `ServerApp/Database`.
- [x] Confirm first accepted version of `DOCS/API.md`.
- [x] Freeze tech stack: `.NET 8`, C#, WinForms, TCP, SQLite, `System.Text.Json`.
- [x] Freeze account-per-machine rule with `username <-> machineId`.
- [x] Freeze supported demo modes: real LAN and local multi-instance.
- [x] Freeze minimal chat scope: 1-1 text only, no emoji, no history, no file/image.
- [x] Confirm Week 1 task ownership for all 6 members.
- [x] Confirm branch naming rule and commit naming rule.
- [x] Confirm bug report format and test matrix format.
- [x] Confirm source-of-truth docs:
  - `LEADER_FLOW.md` for phase, scope, ownership, branch rules, commit rules, and release decisions
  - `API.md` for packet/auth/session contract
  - `TASKS.md` for current execution status
  - `BUGS.md` for risks, unresolved issues, and runtime bugs

### Member 3 Phase 0 Review

Member 3 has reviewed and accepted the server GUI scope for Phase 0.

- [x] Confirmed owned UI scope:
  - admin login form
  - dashboard shell
  - machine list and machine status rendering
  - admin control area for lock, unlock, notification, timer, and chat
  - admin-side realtime display
  - WinForms UI thread-safe update pattern for server-side events
- [x] Confirmed write scope:
  - primary runtime area: `Code/ServerApp/`
  - server-side UI folders and UI-facing services only
- [x] Confirmed non-owned areas:
  - packet schema and shared DTOs stay with Member 2
  - socket dispatcher stays with Member 2
  - auth/database internals stay with Member 5
  - client UI stays with Member 4
- [x] Confirmed dependencies:
  - Member 2 still needs to provide network-facing service/interface shape
  - Member 5 still needs to provide admin auth result shape
  - Member 1 controls phase order and scope changes
- [x] Confirmed dependency status:
  - network-facing service/interface shape is not available yet
  - admin auth result shape is not available yet
  - these are Phase 1/Phase 2 handoff dependencies, not blockers for Member 3 Phase 0 completion
- [x] Confirmed Phase 0 repo state:
  - `Code/ServerApp/` exists with planned folders
  - runtime implementation has not started yet, which is acceptable for Phase 0
- [x] Confirmed next Member 3 action:
  - review `DOCS/API.md` in Phase 1 and list exact dashboard data/actions needed from Member 2 and Member 5

## 3. Phase 1 Immediate Start Tasks

## 6. Cross-Member Dependencies

- Member 3 waits on Member 2 for network-facing interface.
- Member 4 waits on Member 2 for client-facing network interface.
- Member 2 waits on Member 5 for auth interface details during login integration.
- Member 3 waits on Member 5 for admin login/auth result behavior.
- Member 4 waits on Member 2 and Member 5 for real client login behavior.
- Member 6 waits on all members for build output, feature status, and bug reproduction.
- All members wait on Member 1 for final stack, scope, and gate approval.

## 7. Conflict Watch List

These are the most likely overlap areas:

- `DOCS/API.md`: Member 2 edits, Member 1 approves, Member 5 reviews auth/session shape.
- `Shared/`: Member 2 owns packet/runtime shared transport models.
- login flow: Member 2 owns transport path, Member 5 owns auth logic, Member 3/4 own UI response.
- timer state: Member 2 owns transport, Member 5 owns persistence if stored, Member 3/4 own display only.
- account-to-`machineId` validation: Member 5 owns validation logic, Member 2 owns transport field path, Member 3/4 own display only.
- README/run guide: Member 6 updates, Member 1 reviews final top-level alignment.

## 8. Weekly Reporting Format

Each member should report in this shape:

- completed
- in progress
- blocked by
- next task
- docs that need update

## 9. Done This Turn

## 10. Next Review Checkpoint

Before moving beyond `Gate B`, Member 1 should verify:

- [ ] solution builds successfully.
- [ ] server and client can connect successfully.
- [ ] at least one packet can be exchanged.
- [ ] invalid packet does not crash the receiver.
- [ ] two local client instances can connect or the blocker is documented.
- [ ] receive loop does not freeze UI.
- [ ] local multi-instance test works.
- [ ] networking handoff does not conflict with auth ownership.
- [ ] no GUI member is parsing packet shape independently.
